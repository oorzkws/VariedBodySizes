This mod adds some new settings to rimworld. It allows you to individually set a customized size range for all pawns and animal sizes. This change is strictly cosmetic and alters no other statistics of the pawn or animal.

You can also enable functional changes as well. By enabling "Also modify actual bodysize" in the mod config you will also alter the "body size" stat. This affects things like calculating meat amount, leather amount, carry capacity and various other stats. It can also be used in other mods for all sorts of reasons. Basically since this setting modifies the body size stat, it will be included in those types of calculations. 

You can enable the "Also modify health scaling" to make pawns health pool be affected by bodysize as well. This affects how much damage each pawn and their bodyparts has. There is also the "Also modify melee damage" that makes all melee attacks damage scale with the changed body-size.

Load order should not matter as all calculations are done after game-start.
There are debug-options to change the sizes of pawns manually.
